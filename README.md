gif-parser
==========

This program decodes a GIF and outputs a binary [Netpbm] file.

This project is inspired by an assignment for my [Systems Programming] class. My
goal is to apply our implementation of the LZW compression algorithm to a
real-world problem. Unfortunately, I'm not permitted to share some of the source
for the assignment: ``BitUnpacker.c``, ``CodeSet.c``, ``LZWExp.c``.
